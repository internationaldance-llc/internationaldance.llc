[Definitive edition of "How to Favicon" in 2023](https://dev.to/masakudamatsu/favicon-nightmare-how-to-maintain-sanity-3al7) [ 2023.08.11 ]
I thought adding a favicon to my website was a simple thing: create a file called favicon.ico, save it in the root directory, and add the code to the `<head>` section of the HTML file. I was wrong. ~ [Masa Kudamatsu](https://dev.to/masakudamatsu)

[When to Nest](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/when-to-nest-css/) [ 2023.10.05 ]
With the recent news that CSS nesting is now available in the major evergreen browsers, our team was discussing how it differs from nesting in Sass, and the question came up — When should you use nesting? ~ [Scott Vandehey](https://cloudfour.com/is/scott/)

[Custom CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) [ 2023.06.09 ]
I removed the height: 100% from html and body. This rule was added to make it possible to use percentage-based heights within the application. Now that dynamic viewport units are well-supported, however, this hacky fix is no longer required. ~ [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)

[color-scheme](https://web.dev/articles/color-scheme) [ 2020.04.08 ]
Improved dark mode default styling with the color-scheme CSS property and the corresponding meta tag ~ [Thomas Steiner](https://blog.tomayac.com/)

[Creating a CSS-Only Toggle Switch](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68017/creating-a-css-only-toggle-switch) [ 2022.10.11 ]
Many articles about this topic are "outdated" or implement old-school solutions (even the most recently published ones!) Also, most overlook essential parts of web development, such as web accessibility or usability. Finally, I wanted to go beyond the "what" or the "how" and focus on the "why." ~ [Alvaro Montoro](https://alvaromontoro.com/)

[You Don’t Need A UI Framework](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/) [ 2022.05.03 ]
Developers often reach for UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI, hoping that they’ll save a bunch of time and quickly build a professional-looking app. Unfortunately, things rarely work out this way. Let’s talk about it. ~ [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/josh-comeau/)

[The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) [ 2022.11.29 ]
The truth is, if you want to build the most-accessible product possible, you need to use both pixels and ems/rems. It's not an either/or situation. There are circumstances where rems are more accessible, and other circumstances where pixels are more accessible. ~ [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)

[Change favicon based on dark/light color mode](https://www.codewithshripal.com/tips/css/change-favicon-based-on-dark-light-mode) [ 2022.05.19 ]
When we use dark color mode, all the native application windows also changes its color to dark. This cause issue that favicon designed for light color mode no longer getting visible properly on dark color mode. ~ [Shripal Soni](https://www.codewithshripal.com/authors/shripal-soni)
