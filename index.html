              <summary><h1>ABOUT</h1></summary>

              <p>
                International Dance, LLC. was founded as the School of International Dance by Christina Heimlich in 1962. The school is directed by Elizabeth Hawkins. Assistant director Rebecca Collier and our instructors are Miss Elizabeth, Miss Becca, Miss Sarah, Miss Victoria, Miss Natalie, and Miss Misha.
              </p>

              <p>
                Within the school we have a group of advanced dancers called "The Christina Heimlich Dancers." They
                perform and carry on the traditions that uphold the standards of our founder.
              </p>

              <p>
                We want to take this opportunity to let you know a little more about our program. As a student, your
                child will learn about pre-ballet or ballet, creative movement as well as international folk and character dance. Some classes also study tap and jazz. Participation in our classes will encourage development of motor coordination skills, balance, partnering, flexibility, strength, concentration, independence, creativity through use of imagination, poise, posture, rhythm, discipline - all while having fun and learning about music and dance.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have a deep, rich, and inspirational 60 year history and tradition of teaching dance to thousands of students, many for an average of 12 years. There is an expectation of excellence and professionalism associated with International Dance, LLC and the Christina Heimlich Dancers. With hundreds of original choreographed dances and well over one thousand handmade dance costumes, our talented dance teachers and dedicated parents are a rare treasure unique to International Dance, LLC.

              <summary><h2>Overview</h2></summary>
              <p>
                Classes are held in Alexandria, Virginia and are available for ages three years to adult.  Classes run from 30 minutes to 2 hours in length. Participation in our classes develops coordination and motor skills, balance, flexibility, strength, concentration, poise, posture, and discipline while having fun and learning about music and dance.
              </p>
              <p>
                International Dance's designed method and quality program follows a structured sequence of training stages intended to increase your dancer's technical skills, stamina and discipline in accordance with their age and physical development. We work hard to emphasize correct placement in order to prevent injury. Our curriculum embraces traditional ballet principles and incorporates elements of the French, Italian, and Russian training systems. These methods help to provide a healthy and enjoyable learning environment and allow the dancers to experience a feeling of mastery in each level. It is a style that readily adapts to meet the demands of any choreographer, any company, and any style of movement. Our strength is in our personal and individual attention with each student, training them to strive for excellence.

              <summary><h2>Method of Assessment (class placement)</h2></summary>
              <p>
                All new and returning students will be evaluated for placement.  Each dancer will be carefully placed at a level that ensures maximum progress.  Although students are placed according to age for beginning levels, students with previous training may be placed into classes depending on their ability, strength, and previous development. Final placement is at the discretion of the Director and instructors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Advancement depends upon application, attitude, artistic abilities, dance accomplishment, and physical qualifications, and not necessarily upon age, or length of time spent studying dance. Students will be assessed on ability and accomplishment of certain expectations before being invited to participate in a higher level of training. We keep our program consistent with worldwide expectations and age-appropriate development.

                <summary><h3>Intermediate Ballet: I and II</h3></summary>
                <p>
                  In <strong>Intermediate I Ballet</strong>, attention is paid to the proper extension of the legs and shape of the feet, developing movement sequences, port de bras and balance. Dancers will see an increase in difficulty in barre and center work. Dancers begin to focus on repetition and retention. Intermediate Ballet training becomes much more serious. Some classes will focus on pointe work, pirouettes, use of the head and upper body, fluidity of port de bras and the intricacies of small and large jumps. International Folk and Character technique and combinations are developed with focus placed on personal presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Intermediate II Ballet</strong> continues the dancers' education. Level II keeps the attention and maintains the level of everything in Intermediate Ballet I while adding more repetitions, longer exercises, increased pointe strengthening, and challenging each dancer to increase their knowledge of dance vocabulary as well as a combination of exposure to classic ballets, ballet variations and styles.

                <p>
                  <strong>Advanced I Ballet</strong> becomes more rigorous. Classes focus on pointe work, multiple pirouettes, fluidity of movement and the intricacies of small and large jumps. This class focuses on fine details, use of the upper body, breath of movement and expression, as well as an increasingly advanced repertory of steps. Focused attention is given to each advanced dancer enhancing their strengths and broadening their abilities. Character Dance is integral to a classical ballet repertoire. It is a stylized representation of traditional folk or national dance, normally from European countries and uses movements and dance which have been adapted for the theatre. Many classic ballets include and feature character dance. It is an integral part of International Dance, LLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Advanced II Ballet</strong> focuses on all aspects introduced in Advanced Ballet I and more. Students are expected to be the utmost professional during class and these classes will prepare them for post high school. Advanced Ballet II will also focus on more classical variations. Dancers are expected to pick up choreography more quickly and delve into their artistry.

                <summary><h3>Lyrical: I, II, and III</h3></summary>
                <p>
                  Lyrical dance combines elements of ballet, jazz, and modern with a huge emphasis on emotions. Lyrical is typically performed to songs with lyrics and is danced with movement to convey the emotion of the song. Dancers in lyrical will enjoy movements that focus on flexibility and fluidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Lyrical I</strong><br />
                  Lyrical I is an introductory class to lyrical. Dancers will begin exploring emoting through movement while continuing to build on their ballet technique. Dancers will begin training their bodies to move in more parallel, contracted, and flexed positions. Dancers should be able to correctly execute basic lyrical movements such as single pirouettes from a parallel position, basic seat rolls and shoulder rolls, basic leaps and jumps, and be able to show the appropriate emotion through the movements taught.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Lyrical II</strong><br/>
                  Dancers will continue to build upon basic lyrical moments while adding more complex and intricate movement. Dancers will continue to improve upon previously learned leaps, jumps, rolls, and turns as well as adding more difficult variations. Dancers should be able to correctly execute moments such as double pirouettes from a parallel position, a wider variety of leaps and jumps, more complex variations of seat and shoulder rolls, understand the basics a la seconde, and be able to show a wider range of emotions through the moments taught.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Lyrical III</strong><br />
                  Dancers will be challenged to explore more advanced lyrical movements. We will introduce improve and student choreography, as dancers will be asked to choreograph their own few 8 counts to end a given combination. Dancers should be able to correctly execute movements such as a polished double and triple pirouette from a parallel position, more complex leaps and jump combinations, more complex variations of seat and shoulder rolls, an a la seconde turning combination, and be able to show a wide range of emotions through the movement taught and be able to appropriately emote through those movements.

Dancers are encouraged to complete the entire year in order to receive the full benefit of the planned curriculum. In order to keep up with the class level, dancers must maintain good attendance and commit to arriving 10 minutes prior to class. This ensures dancers ample time to properly warm up and prevent injury. However, if a dancer does arrive after the class has begun, he or she may enter with minimum disruption to other dancers. If possible please inform the front desk if you will be tardy.

Make-up classes are in addition to the dancer's regular classes. Classes can be made up anytime within the current season but cannot be accumulated at the end of the season in place of the last four-week payment. A class for which a dancer has enrolled cannot be dropped and then used for a make-up class. No dancer may make-up a class if they have not paid for their current four-week period in which the make-up class is to be taken. No classes may be carried over from the fall-winter course to the summer course or from the summer course to the fall-winter course.

              <summary><h2>Behavior</h2></summary>
              <p>
                International Dance strives to provide a safe and supportive community that fosters a lifelong love for dance and creative expression. As such, International Dance expects each and every dancer, assistant, teacher, instructor, staff member and or parent/guardian to respect and be kind to each other at all times. International Dance does not tolerate bullying in any form; physical, emotional, social or otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
                International Dance defines bullying as any behavior; physical, verbal, written (electronically or in person), that purposely and detrimentally targets another dancer, assistant, teacher, instructor, staff member and or parent/guardian.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reports of bullying will be investigated, verified, and documented by International Dance staff members. This investigation may include but is not limited to contacting the alleged bullying party, the alleged victim, teachers, assistants, and parent/guardians who may have possibly witnessed the event(s). If staff investigation produces corroborating evidence of the report, it will be documented and serve as the basis for a course of action. International Dance director, Elizabeth Hawkins, also reviews any and all reports of bullying.
              </p>
              <p>
                Verified and documented reports may have severe consequences up to and including immediate termination of enrollment without refund for classes missed.
              </p>
              <p>
                As per the policy above, International Dance recognizes that bullying does not just occur between dancers. Parents or guardians who are witnessed as bullying or harassing another dancer, assistant, teacher, instructor, staff member and or parent/guardian, are equally subject to the above policies and consequences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here at International Dance we know how we behave specifically affects the learning environment. With a respectful, kind, safe atmosphere, anything is possible. Let's choose to be kind.

                <p>
                  For general safety reasons, we insist that all performers remain backstage during the recital performances. Depending on the venue during rehearsals students of International Dance may be allowed to sit with their class and watch the other classes. We have plenty of staff backstage to keep your dancers entertained while they wait for their dance. If your dancer is in our youngest classes, we may have the dancers sit with parents after their performance. We will communicate with parents so that this can be a smooth transition.
