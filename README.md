# International Dance, LLC.

Founded in 1962 by Prima Ballerina Christina Heimlich, International Dance has inspired dancers for generations.

Today, Miss Heimlich's legacy and mantel are taken to new heights with International Dance alumni, Shenandoah University Graduate, and current International Dance Owner, CEO, and Director Elizabeth (Banks) Hawkins.

Miss Elizabeth, instructors, and staff value and invest award-winning passion, discipline, and excellence into student lives, families, and the community, through the art of dance.

The thriving Alexandria (soon to be Annandale) VA premier school of dance offers non-competitive classical ballet, tap, jazz, modern, lyrical, folk, and character dance instruction, year-round, for all ages.
